## File streaming from server to client side.

If we have to send a very large file from server to client side so its very difficult due to we have to measure percentage of how much file have been sent. But an alternate of it we can stream file to client and then download it at client side.

Streaming file method is very stable and also shows us how much file have been downloaded and it uses disk to download file not RAM so memory saving is also a feature of this method.

In this example I have streamed 3 bytes of string 1000 times which means I am sharing 3000 bytes of file you can replace those 3 bytes by the bytes of your big file.
